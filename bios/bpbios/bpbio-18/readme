GPL Release of Banked and Portable (B/P) Bios for the Micromint SB-180

This release contains modifications by Scott Coburn for enhanced baud
rate setting and speed selection if the HD64180 processor is replaced by
a Z8S180, as well as modifications to remove IO wait states for all but
Floppy Disk Accesses.

The Base file is BPBIO-18.Z80 and draws other .Z80 and .LIB files in as
needed under the DEF-18.LIB configuration file (template versions for
boot images and banked images are DEFBOOT and DEFBANK respectively).

Two versions of the Banked ZSDOS2 BDOS are provided as:
	ZS227G.ZRL - Non-hashed base version
	ZS203.ZRL  - Capable of using Hashed directories
