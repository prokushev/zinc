
; Set BIOS Bank Numbers to the RAM base Number as set by Boot ROM.  In-context
; RAM will be reflected in CBR which is base.  We adjust other bank numbers
; based on configured differences, except for MaxBnk which remains as config'd.
; Since the bootable systems (MOVCPM set to YES) are not banked, the Fast boot
; option should be OFF, and only the TPABNK will necessarily be Accurate.
