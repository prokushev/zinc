================
TOKENL
  TOKENL  Compare a passed string to a list of keywords. If it matches,
          returns the index of the keyword in A (0,1,2,3 etc.) with Carry set.
          If it fails, it returns Carry reset.
          There are two matching modes: exact and prefix. In exact mode, the
          passed string must be followed by a non-alpha character. In prefix
          mode, there is no check for this (so passed string "PREFIX" matches 
          keyword "PRE"). 

          Enter: B=match mode 0=prefix 1=exact
                 DE->string
                 HL->token table: DB 'Word1',0,'Word2',0, ... ,0,0
                
                 Returns result in A, success in Carry flag; all other 
                 registers intact. Other flags corrupt.
 
TOKENG
  TOKENG  Pull token no. C out of a token table. Returns HL=address of token
          or HL=0 if there aren't that many tokens in the table.

String routines
===============
STRLEN
  STRLEN  Return length in A of 0-terminated string at HL. Uses AF.
STRCHR
  STRCHR  If character in A is contained in string at HL, return Carry set
         and HL->first instance of character. Else return Carry clear 
         and HL=0
